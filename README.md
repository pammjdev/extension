# MJ Store Expander

## Notice
Any issues encountered using this extension are not the fault of IHeartJane or Jane Technologies. This is a homemade extension that assumes a lot of functionality will just work from store to store. If the extension does not work for you please contact me with the store ID and what doesn't work to research the issue. pammjdev@gmail.com

## Install
This add-on works in Firefox only

To install, click the following link while using Firefox https://expander-extension.s3.amazonaws.com/StoreExpander-1.7.5.xpi
When the link is clicked in firefox, the first notification you get is Firefox confirming you intended to install an add-on when you clicked on a link in GitHub.

![Add to Firefox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pammjdev/extension/main/images/add.jpg)

If the XPI downloads instead of letting you Add, it may be because you are not using Firefox. Confirm what browser is being used to install XPI

### Note
After pressing Add, it will ask if extension should have access to private windows. If you wish to shop using private windows you will need to allow access. If you do not plan to use private windows you do not need to give permission.

### Important: When opening the Store Expander, if you have your dispensary PoS website open (Example dispensary website that uses IHJ chosen by random https://risecannabis.com/dispensary-menu/pennsylvania/duncansville-medical-menu/ ) then open the Store Expander, it will automatically pull the Store ID for you and load the inventory. Example of opening the store expansion while on the risecannabis PoS website

![Load Store](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pammjdev/extension/main/images/loading.jpg)

After opening expansion and it automatically displays store ID it will begin automatically loading store data. Give it a moment to load, the screen should look like this while loading. If loading does not complete please contact me with store ID to fix.

When store is finished loading user will see new filters on left and dispensary inventory on the right. Clicking the underlined product name will cause a new tab to be opened behind the extension with the IHJ website for that product and store. Pressing Esc key or clicking the red X in the extension will close it so you can look at product website. Reopening extension (while same store is active tab) causes extension to reload with last filtering applied so you can continue where left off easily.

Open the 'Order By' dropdown for new options like 'Price Per Gram' and Terpene Total.

Terpene By Name becomes enabled when you open the left side 'Terpenes' category and filter by a specific terpene.

![Loaded Store](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pammjdev/extension/main/images/new_ordering.jpg)

Example filtering by include terpene B-Pinene. This will show only products with B-Pinene listed in them, and will put the inventory with the highest percent of that specific terpene at the top of the list.

Mouse over the different colored blocks to see terpene name and specific total.

It is also possible to exclude terpene and show medicine with the least amount. Checking the second checkbox in Terpenes filter category will order the inventory by displaying medicine without the terpene first, then those with the smallest percent. It will not show inventory with no Terpenes listed (if the product description did not supply it or it is 'Gear' that does not have terpenes).

![Exclude Terpene Filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pammjdev/extension/main/images/order_by_specific_terpene_exclude.jpg)

You can also order by 'Terpene Total' percent by selecting that option in the Order By dropdown. This example shows all products and lists the highest Total Terp first.

![Order By Terpene Total](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pammjdev/extension/main/images/order_by_terpene_total.jpg)

Example of filtering by Flower products, and ordering them by 'Price Per Gram: Low to High'. This will show the lowest PPG first.

If you move the mouse over the cost of the item, it will display the PPG.

PPG = Price % Weight. Ex: $28/7g = $4.0 $/g (Price per gram)

![Order By Price Per Gram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pammjdev/extension/main/images/price_per_gram.jpg)

You can search through the filters by typing in the 'Search in Filter' input.

This example user typed 'tys' and the Brand filter for 'TYSON 2.0' is the one to display.

Checking the filter only displays TYSON 2.0 brand products in the inventory.
