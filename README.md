# MJ Store Expander

## Notice
Any issues encountered using this website are not the fault of IHeartJane or Jane Technologies. This is a homemade website that assumes a lot of functionality will just work from store to store. If it does not work for you please contact me with the store number/website and what doesn't work to research the issue. pammjdev@gmail.com Do not reach out to your dispensary or IHJ/Jane Technologies.

## Limitations
The store inventory may be up to 24 hours old. This is because I worked hard to play nice with Jane Technologies, in the name of free use, since I am not affiliated with them. I implemented a webservice I run, that only pulls the API data once a day for each store being accessed by users. It then saves the inventory so that if the data is needed again in the same day, it uses my webservice saved data and does not access IHeartJane(IHJ) again. I did this to lower the number of times the IHJ service has to be called.
