# MJ Store Expander

## Notice
Any issues encountered using this extension are not the fault of IHeartJane or Jane Technologies. This is a homemade extension that assumes a lot of functionality will just work from store to store. If the extension does not work for you please contact me with the store ID and what doesn't work to research the issue. pammjdev@gmail.com

## Install
This add-on works in Firefox only

To install, click the following link while using Firefox https://expander-extension.s3.amazonaws.com/StoreExpander-1.7.5.xpi
When the link is clicked in firefox, the first notification you get is Firefox confirming you intended to install an add-on when you clicked on a link in GitHub.

If the XPI downloads instead of letting you Add, it may be because you are not using Firefox. Confirm what browser is being used to install XPI

### Important
After pressing Add, it will ask if extension should have access to private windows. If you wish to shop using private windows you will need to allow access. If you do not plan to use private windows you do not need to give permission.

### Important: When opening the Store Expander, if you have your dispensary PoS website open (Example dispensary website that uses IHJ chosen by random https://risecannabis.com/dispensary-menu/pennsylvania/duncansville-medical-menu/ ) then open the Store Expander, it will automatically pull the Store ID for you and load the inventory. Example of opening the store expansion while on the risecannabis PoS website

### After opening expansion and it automatically displays store ID it will begin automatically loading store data. Give it a moment to load, the screen should look like this while loading. If loading does not complete please contact me with store ID to fix.
